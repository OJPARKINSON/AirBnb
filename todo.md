# Todo

<!-- - Sort out the node js server file structure // clean the code up  -->

- Re think the client side routing so that the id's are in the header but only if logged in they can see the protected contents.

- Re-work the login using session storage
    - Make sure that the navigation is fixed on the front end
    - Make middleware that checks a user is logged in
